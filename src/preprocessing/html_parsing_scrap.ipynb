The country's overall pharmaceutical rating falls below the quarterly regional average, due to small and falling population numbers that limit its overall size, and an economy that is highly exposed to external risk. In fact, we forecast that the current economic adversity will have a marked negative effect on the value of the Latvian pharmaceutical market in 2009, expecting a negligible 0.75% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in local currency terms, from LVL256mn (US$510mn) in 2008. This figure stands in stark contrast to the pre-2008 double-digit growth rates, which had been driven by high usage of medical services and high levels of per capita consumption. \\n\\nOver the next five years, we expect that the market will recover marginally, to post a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.06% in local currency terms. Generic medicines will remain prioritised under the public healthcare system, which should push their share of the total market to over 30% by 2014, up from 27.4% recorded in 2008. At the same time, patented medicines - where possible - will be sidelined by hospitals as much as patients, who have to foot a considerable proportion of their medicines bill. The over-the-counter (OTC) sector will also face challenging times ahead, despite the government's attempts to address the overuse of medical services. \\n\\nBMI believes that 2009 will see significant shortfalls in state-funded healthcare services. Major restructuring of the Ministry of Health is to be realised, with staff numbers set to be slashed by 60% and the Public Health Agen...   \n",

The downgrade reflects Casa Blanca's decline in assessed valuation (AV) and the resulting erosion in pledged revenues and the likelihood of further AV declines in both project areas and the negative impact on pledged revenues. \\n\\n\\--Debt service coverage remains satisfactory despite the recent property value decline and holds up adequately to Fitch's stress scenarios. \\n\\n\\--Both project areas are highly concentrated with the top ten taxpayers accounting for between 30% and 40% of AV and incremental AV (IV). \\n\\n\\--Both project areas are experiencing heightened levels of appeals as a result of the steep decline and softening, respectively, in the residential and commercial property markets. Furthermore, with little new construction activity, Fitch expects that there will be minimal or no offset to declines in existing properties. \\n\\n\\--Both project areas are mature and have very high IV-to-base year values, resulting in low revenue volatility should AV decline. \\n\\n\\--Bondholder protections include average additional bonds tests. \\n\\nKEY RATING DRIVER(S): \\n\\n\\--Maintenance of adequate debt service coverage levels. \\n\\nGood prospects for future development in the medium-to-long term. \\n\\nSECURITY: \\n\\nThe bonds are secured by loan repayments to the authority from tax increment revenue in each...   \n",

       "75025  PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \\n\\n**Arterial Remodeling Technologies** **(“ART”)** announced today that it has disclosed impressive _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ data related to its bioresorbable stent platform—data that validates the Company’s approach to simultaneously balance **biocompatibility** , **biomechanics** and **bioresorption** in a bioresorbable PLA (polylactic acid) stent without altering healing by drug elution from the stent platform. \\n\\nThese data have been published in the current special supplement of _EuroIntervention_ , a peer-reviewed journal. The paper is authored by **Antoine Lafont, M.D., Ph.D., Head, Interventional Cardiology Department, Georges Pompidou Hospital (Paris); Past Chairman, Interventional Cardiology Group, European Society of Cardiology (ESC)**. \\n\\n“The ART bioresorbable stent showed a remarkable ability to be deployed without recoil or breakage. At one month, endothelialization was one hundred percent completed. Additionally important, inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen accumulation were equivalent to what typically occurs after balloon angioplasty,” said Dr. Lafont, a co-founder of ART. “At six months, the ART stent was completely integrated into the artery wall, thus preventing any strut migration secondary to the bioresorption process. Further, peak PLA resorption did not result in an increase or even persistence of inflammation as it has been previously reported with other bioresorbable polymer stents. Finally, inflammation and smooth muscle cell proliferation were almost not detectable at six months, resulting in no hyperplasia—in other words, no in-stent restenosis.” \\n\\n“These results dramatically confirm our approach to bioresorbable stenting,” said **Machiel van der Leest** , CEO. “The industry has been focusing on mechanical strength of the scaffold. Of course, this is important for the first three months in order to give an artery proper support. But after this period the stent will no longer ha...   \n",

       "74843  \\n\\nDUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \\n\\nResearch and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/679bd3/latvia_pharmaceuti) has announced the addition of the \"Latvia Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Report Q1 2010\" report to their offering. \\n\\nIn the Business Environment Rating (BER) matrix for Q110, Latvia is once again found a lowly 17th out of the 20 markets surveyed in the Emerging Europe region, below its two Baltic peers. The country's overall pharmaceutical rating falls below the quarterly regional average, due to small and falling population numbers that limit its overall size, and an economy that is highly exposed to external risk. In fact, we forecast that the current economic adversity will have a marked negative effect on the value of the Latvian pharmaceutical market in 2009, expecting a negligible 0.75% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in local currency terms, from LVL256mn (US$510mn) in 2008. This figure stands in stark contrast to the pre-2008 double-digit growth rates, which had been driven by high usage of medical services and high levels of per capita consumption. \\n\\nOver the next five years, we expect that the market will recover marginally, to post a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.06% in local currency terms. Generic medicines will remain prioritised under the public healthcare system, which should push their share of the total market to over 30% by 2014, up from 27.4% recorded in 2008. At the same time, patented medicines - where possible - will be sidelined by hospitals as much as patients, who have to foot a considerable proportion of their medicines bill. The over-the-counter (OTC) sector will also face challenging times ahead, despite the government's attempts to address the overuse of medical services. \\n\\nBMI believes that 2009 will see significant shortfalls in state-funded healthcare services. Major restructuring of the Ministry of Health is to be realised, with staff numbers set to be slashed by 60% and the Public Health Agen...  \n",

       "74875  \\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \\n\\nFitch Ratings takes the following rating action on Riverside Public Financing Authority as part of its continuous surveillance effort: \\n\\n\\--$8.3 million 2007 series A tax allocation bonds (TABs) (Downtown/Airport Merged Redevelopment Project) downgraded to 'BBB' from 'A-'; \\n\\n\\--$14.2 million 2007 series B TABs (Downtown/Airport Merged Redevelopment Project) (taxable) downgraded to 'BBB' from 'A-'. \\n\\nThe Rating Outlook is Stable. \\n\\nRATING RATIONALE: \\n\\n\\--As a several but not joint obligation of the two project areas, the rating is based on Fitch's assessment of the weaker of the two project areas, the Casa Blanca project area. The downgrade reflects Casa Blanca's decline in assessed valuation (AV) and the resulting erosion in pledged revenues and the likelihood of further AV declines in both project areas and the negative impact on pledged revenues. \\n\\n\\--Debt service coverage remains satisfactory despite the recent property value decline and holds up adequately to Fitch's stress scenarios. \\n\\n\\--Both project areas are highly concentrated with the top ten taxpayers accounting for between 30% and 40% of AV and incremental AV (IV). \\n\\n\\--Both project areas are experiencing heightened levels of appeals as a result of the steep decline and softening, respectively, in the residential and commercial property markets. Furthermore, with little new construction activity, Fitch expects that there will be minimal or no offset to declines in existing properties. \\n\\n\\--Both project areas are mature and have very high IV-to-base year values, resulting in low revenue volatility should AV decline. \\n\\n\\--Bondholder protections include average additional bonds tests. \\n\\nKEY RATING DRIVER(S): \\n\\n\\--Maintenance of adequate debt service coverage levels. \\n\\nGood prospects for future development in the medium-to-long term. \\n\\nSECURITY: \\n\\nThe bonds are secured by loan repayments to the authority from tax increment revenue in ...  \n",

       "75025  \\n\\nPARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \\n\\nArterial Remodeling Technologies (“ART”) announced today that it has disclosed impressive in vivo and in vitro data related to its bioresorbable stent platform—data that validates the Company’s approach to simultaneously balance biocompatibility, biomechanics and bioresorption in a bioresorbable PLA (polylactic acid) stent without altering healing by drug elution from the stent platform. \\n\\nThese data have been published in the current special supplement of EuroIntervention, a peer-reviewed journal. The paper is authored by Antoine Lafont, M.D., Ph.D., Head, Interventional Cardiology Department, Georges Pompidou Hospital (Paris); Past Chairman, Interventional Cardiology Group, European Society of Cardiology (ESC). \\n\\n“The ART bioresorbable stent showed a remarkable ability to be deployed without recoil or breakage. At one month, endothelialization was one hundred percent completed. Additionally important, inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen accumulation were equivalent to what typically occurs after balloon angioplasty,” said Dr. Lafont, a co-founder of ART. “At six months, the ART stent was completely integrated into the artery wall, thus preventing any strut migration secondary to the bioresorption process. Further, peak PLA resorption did not result in an increase or even persistence of inflammation as it has been previously reported with other bioresorbable polymer stents. Finally, inflammation and smooth muscle cell proliferation were almost not detectable at six months, resulting in no hyperplasia—in other words, no in-stent restenosis.” \\n\\n“These results dramatically confirm our approach to bioresorbable stenting,” said Machiel van der Leest, CEO. “The industry has been focusing on mechanical strength of the scaffold. Of course, this is important for the first three months in order to give an artery proper support. But after this period the stent will no longer have a support function, yet it wil...  \n",
