	abstract = {Recent imperfect capital market theories predict the presence of asymmetries in the variation of small and large firms' risk over the economic cycle. Small firms with little collateral should be more strongly affected by tighter credit market conditions in a recession state than large, better collateralized ones. This paper adopts a flexible econometric model to analyze these mplications empirically. Consistent with theory, small firms display the highest degree of asymmetry in their risk across recession and expansion states, which translates into a higher sensitivity of their expected stock returns with respect to variables that measure credit market conditions.},

The package MSGARCH allows the user to perform simulations as well as maximum likelihood and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimations of a very large class of Markov-switching GARCH-type models.

Their applications to financial modeling comes from the fact that they generalize the normal (Gaussian) distribution and allow heavy tails and skewness, which are frequently seen in financial data.

In contrast, we propose a class of Markov switching models in which the transition probabilities can vary with fundamentals. We develop an EM algorithm for estimation of the model and we illustrate it with a simulation example.

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

A hidden Markov process ﬁts into a measurement error model if we treat the unobserved and observed components respectively as the latent “true” variable and the observed variables with error. Exploiting the recently developed methodology for measurement error model, we prove that both the Markov transition probability and the conditional probability are identiﬁed from the joint distribution of three consecutive variables given that the cardinality of X is not greater than that of Y. The approach of identiﬁcation provides a novel methodology for estimating the hidden Markov models, with a prominent advantage being global and independent of initial values. A Monte Carlo experiment and a simple empirical illustration for hidden Markov models are also provided. We further extend our methodology to the Markov-switching model which generalizes the hidden Markov model, and show that the extended model can be similarly identiﬁed and estimated from the joint distribution of four consecutive variables.},

For example, the mean growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional, discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these shifts directly, but instead must draw probabilistic inference about whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such estimation of population parameters by the method of maximum likelihood and provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series. An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3\% permanent drop in the level of GNP.},

	abstract = {Throughout history, rich and poor countries alike have been lending, borrowing, crashing--and recovering--their way through an extraordinary range of financial crises. Each time, the experts have chimed, "this time is different"--claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters. With this breakthrough study, leading economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff definitively prove them wrong. Covering sixty-six countries across five continents, This Time Is Different presents a comprehensive look at the varieties of financial crises, and guides us through eight astonishing centuries of government defaults, banking panics, and inflationary spikes--from medieval currency debasements to today's subprime catastrophe. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, leading economists whose work has been influential in the policy debate concerning the current financial crisis, provocatively argue that financial combustions are universal rites of passage for emerging and established market nations. The authors draw important lessons from history to show us how much--or how little--we have learned. Using clear, sharp analysis and comprehensive data, Reinhart and Rogoff document that financial fallouts occur in clusters and strike with surprisingly consistent frequency, duration, and ferocity. They examine the patterns of currency crashes, high and hyperinflation, and government defaults on international and domestic debts--as well as the cycles in housing and equity prices, capital flows, unemployment, and government revenues around these crises. While countries do weather their financial storms, Reinhart and Rogoff prove that short memories make it all too easy for crises to recur. An important book that will affect policy discussions for a long time to come, This Time Is Different exposes centuries of financial missteps.},

Applying the synthetic control method to a sample of 131 defaults since 1900, it finds that, on average, growth in the first two years falls 3.6 and 2.4 percentage points short of the counterfactual. Still, after a decade, defaulters’ economic output per capita is nearly 17 percent below that of the counterfactual. Poverty headcounts—available since the 1980s—exceed their pre-crisis levels by roughly 30 percent shortly after default and remain elevated a decade later.},

We quantify the relief achieved through default and restructuring in two distinct samples: 1920–1939, focusing on the defaults on official (government to government) debt in advanced economies after World War I; and 1978–2010, focusing on emerging market debt crises with private external creditors. Debt relief was substantial in both eras, averaging 21\% of GDP in the 1930s and 16\% of GDP in recent decades. We then analyze the aftermath of debt relief and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis around the synchronous war debt defaults of 1934 and the Baker and Brady initiatives of the 1980s/1990s. The economic landscape of debtor countries improves significantly after debt relief operations, but only if these involve debt write-offs. Softer forms of debt relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings. (JEL: E6, F3, N0, H6)},

Theory predicts that lending to the non-tradable sector, relative to the tradable sector, reﬂects relaxations in credit supply and contributes to boom-bust cycles by increasing ﬁnancial fragility. We show that, during credit booms, credit ﬂows disproportionately to the non-tradable sector, consistent with an important role for easy ﬁnancing conditions. Credit expansions to the non-tradable sector, in turn, systematically predict subsequent growth slowdowns and ﬁnancial crises, similar to household credit expansions. In contrast, lending to the tradable sector coincides with strong output and productivity growth without a higher risk of a ﬁnancial crisis. Our ﬁndings illustrate that heterogeneity in ﬁrm credit is important for understanding macro-ﬁnancial linkages and distinguishing between “good” and “bad” credit expansions.},

„We see that the predicted V aRα is still correct under H1“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 4)
(Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 4) Note how we divide by T instead of N\_T here compared to Test 1.
„Remarkably, these results do not require independence of the Xt’s“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 4)
„This choice however would have not been sufficient to simulate the test statistics and compute p-values“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 5)
„Z1 is not applicable to the examples in which V aR2.5\% varies across the alternatives.“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 6)
(Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 6) Why?
(Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 6) What does coverage mean?
„It is then no coincidence that despite V aR being elicitable, V aR backtests are still based on counting exceptions. If these tests are simple and entail the recording of just one number, it’s not because V aR is elicitabile, but because quantiles define a Bernoulli random variable. Any other elicitable statistic simply does not.“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 10)
„But if, as we have seen, absence of elicitability is not a serious problem for a regulatory risk standard, absence of comonotonic additivity certainly is. An expectile ρ will tell you that a long position in a call option C is partially hedged by a long (yes, long) position in the underlying stock S: ρ(C + S) {\textless} ρ(C) + ρ(S). Even V aR would look perplex.“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 10) note link: "zotero://note/u/BN82UZ6Z/"
„As a side remark, we observe that theoretical results showing that a measure is not elicitable may still not preclude that it is in practice elicitable. We still don’t know whether V aR and ES are jointly elicitable or not, and we wouldn’t be surprised to discover that they are not, but we already know that in practice they are.“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 11)
„Elicitability of a risk measure is not relevant for an absolute model validation. This property is useful for relative comparison of different models forecasting the same process, namely for model selection.“ (Acerbi und Szekely, 2014, p. 12)

The adverse consequences of the GPR index are driven by both the threat and the realization of adverse geopolitical events. We complement our aggregate measures with industry- and firm-level indicators of geopolitical risk. Investment drops more in industries that are exposed to aggregate geopolitical risk.

Estimating a regression model for the ES stand-alone is infeasible and thus, our tests are based on a joint regression model for the Value at Risk (VaR) and the ES, which allows for different test specifications. These ES backtests are the first which solely backtest the ES in the sense that they only require ES forecasts as input variables. As the tests are potentially subject to model misspecification, we provide asymptotic theory under misspecification for the underlying joint regression. We find that employing a misspecification robust covariance estimator substantially improves the tests’ performance. We compare our backtests to existing joint VaR and ES backtests and find that our tests outperform the existing alternatives throughout all considered simulations. In an empirical illustration, we apply our backtests to ES forecasts for 200 stocks of the S\&amp;P 500 index.},

“our tests are based on a joint regression model for the Value at Risk (VaR) and the ES” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 437)
“The primary difficulty in directly backtesting ES is its non-elicitability and non-identifiability (Weber, 2006; Gneiting, 2011; Fissler and Ziegel, 2016; Fissler, Ziegel, and Gneiting, 2016) as consequently, there is no analog to the hit sequence which is the natural identification function of quantiles and which lies at the heart of almost all VaR backtests.” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 438) Hello great comment
“Examples include tests based on the entire tail distribution, a linear approximation of the ES through several quantiles, or the pair consisting of the VaR and the ES.” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 438)
Referred in Expected Shortfall - General Overview
“it is formally a joint backtest for the VaR and ES which, however, mainly focuses on the ES by only testing the ES-specific regression parameters” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 439)
“We refer to this backtest as the Intercept ESR backtest. This test allows for both, testing against one-sided and two-sided alternatives.” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 439)
Referred in Expected Shortfall - General Overview
“Thus, the regulators only have to prevent and penalize the underestimation of the financial risks, which demonstrates the necessity of one-sided testing procedures.” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 439)
“In the second setup, we introduce a new technique for evaluating the power of backtests for financial risk measures, where we continuously misspecify certain model parameters of the DGP to obtain a continuum of alternative models with a gradually increasing degree of misspecification.” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 440)
“Given that the financial returns Yt follow some pure scale (volatility) process, it holds that the VaR and ES forecasts are perfectly colinear, {\textasciicircum} et ¼ c{\textasciicircum} vt for some c 2 R.” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 444)
“A unique and essential feature of the Strict and Intercept ESR backtests is that they solely require forecasts for the ES and are consequently the first backtests for the ES stand-alone.” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 463)
“Expectiles are suggested as they are coherent, elicitable, and are able to capture extreme risks beyond the VaR and thus, they simultaneously overcome the drawbacks of the VaR and the ES (Bellini et al., 2014; Ziegel, 2016). Unfortunately, as opposed to the VaR and ES, they lack a visual and intuitive interpretation (Emmer, Kratz, and Tasche, 2015).” (Bayer and Dimitriadis, 2022, p. 463)

The study employs a panel of 28 countries over the period 1986-2002. Several control variables are introduced in the regressions to account for other factors affecting exchange rate volatility (monetary and external indicators as well as conventional macroeconomic fundamentals). The paper controls for the endogeneity induced by the role of the exchange rate regime, since the regime can affect both the level of reserves and exchange rate volatility. The results provide ample support for the proposition that holding adequate reserves reduces exchange rate volatility. The effect is strong and robust; moreover, it is nonlinear and appears to operate through a signaling effect.},

However, interventions in emerging markets are different from those in advanced economies: they occur ‘regularly’ and central banks have considerable leverage, derived from relatively high reserves, some non-sterilisation, the central bank’s information advantage and capital controls. Consequently, these interventions often successfully impact the level and volatility of exchange rates. Nevertheless, more research on interventions in emerging markets is needed analysing the influence of heterogeneous institutional circumstances, examining the role of central bank communication and using high-frequency data.},

Theoretically, large precautionary demand for international reserves arises as a self-insurance to avoid costly liquidation of long-term projects when the economy is susceptible to sudden stops. The welfare gain from the optimal management of international reserves is of a first-order magnitude, reducing the welfare cost of liquidity shocks from a first-order to a second-order magnitude.},

Because policy options are limited in the midst of a capital market crisis and because so many countries have already had crises recently, we focus on some of the  policies that could reduce the incidence of crises in the first place, or at least make the sudden stop problem less severe.  In this regard, we consider the relative merits of capital controls and dollarization.   We conclude that, while the evidence suggests that capital controls appear to influence the composition of flows skewing flows away from short maturities, such policies are not likely to be a long-run solution to the recurring problem of sudden capital flow reversals. Yet, because fear of floating, many emerging markets are likely to turn to increased reliance on controls. Dollarization would appear to have the edge as a more market-oriented option to ameliorate, if not eliminate, the sudden stop problem.},

These reserves have climbed to almost 30\% of developing countries' GDP and 8 months of imports.

Conditional on existing levels of short-term foreign borrowing, this does not seem too steep a price as an insurance premium against financial crises. But why developing countries have not tried harder to reduce short-term foreign liabilities in order to achieve the same level of liquidity (thereby paying a smaller cost in terms of reserve accumulation) remains an important puzzle.},

In both cases, the findings are consistent with officially stated policy objectives, which aim to minimize the effect of intervention on the exchange rate, but cast doubt on claims that intervention is a useful tool for smoothing volatility. Although these findings cannot be generalized to other emerging markets, intervention's apparently limited effectiveness highlights the need for central banks to use their scarce foreign reserves selectively and parsimoniously.},

	abstract = {In the recent Basel Accords, the Expected Shortfall (ES) replaces the Value-at-Risk (VaR) as the standard risk measure for market risk in the banking sector, making it the most important risk measure in financial regulation. One of the most challenging tasks in risk modeling practice is to backtest ES forecasts provided by financial institutions. Ideally, backtesting should be done based only on daily realized portfolio losses without imposing specific models. Recently, the notion of e-values has gained attention as potential alternatives to p-values as measures of uncertainty, significance and evidence. We use e-values and e-processes to construct a model-free backtesting procedure for ES using a concept of universal e-statistics, which can be naturally generalized to many other risk measures and statistical quantities.},

	abstract = {Under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) capital charges for the trading book are based on the coherent expected shortfall (ES) risk measure, which show greater sensitivity to tail risk. In this paper it is argued that backtesting of expected shortfall - or the trading book model from which it is calculated - can be based on a simultaneous multinomial test of value-at-risk (VaR) exceptions at different levels, an idea supported by an approximation of ES in terms of multiple quantiles of a distribution proposed in Emmer et al. (2015). By comparing Pearson, Nass and likelihood-ratio tests (LRTs) for different numbers of VaR levels \$N\$ it is shown in a series of simulation experiments that multinomial tests with \$N{\textbackslash}geq 4\$ are much more powerful at detecting misspecifications of trading book loss models than standard binomial exception tests corresponding to the case \$N=1\$. Each test has its merits: Pearson offers simplicity; Nass is robust in its size properties to the choice of \$N\$; the LRT is very powerful though slightly over-sized in small samples and more computationally burdensome. A traffic-light system for trading book models based on the multinomial test is proposed and the recommended procedure is applied to a real-data example spanning the 2008 financial crisis.},

This regression is based on strictly consistent loss functions for the pair consisting of the quantile and the ES, which allow for M- and Z-estimation of the joint regression parameters. We show consistency and asymptotic normality for both estimators under weak regularity conditions. The underlying loss functions depend on two specification functions, whose choices affect the properties of the resulting estimators. We find that the Z-estimator is numerically unstable and thus, we rely on M-estimation of the model parameters. Extensive simulations verify the asymptotic properties and analyze the small sample behavior of the M-estimator for different specification functions. This joint regression framework allows for various applications including estimating, forecasting and backtesting ES, which is particularly relevant in light of the recent introduction of the ES into the Basel Accords. We illustrate this through two exemplary empirical applications in forecasting and forecast combination of the ES.},

However, complex language can also reflect the provision of complex information, e.g., informative technical disclosure. As a consequence, linguistic complexity commingles two latent components — obfuscation and information — that are related to information asymmetry in opposite directions. We develop a novel empirical approach to estimate these two latent components within the context of quarterly earnings conference calls. We validate our estimates of these two latent components by examining their relation to information asymmetry. Consistent with our predictions, we find that our estimate of the information component is negatively associated with information asymmetry while our estimate of the obfuscation component is positively associated with information asymmetry. Our findings suggest that future research on linguistic complexity can construct more powerful tests by separately examining these two latent components of linguistic complexity.},

Experimental results show that our model can achieve nearly 6\% improvements on S\&P 500 index prediction and individual stock prediction, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. In addition, market simulation results show that our system is more capable of making profits than previously reported systems trained on S\&P 500 stock historical data.},

	abstract = {Designing profitable trading strategies is complex as stock movements are highly stochastic; the market is influenced by large volumes of noisy data across diverse information sources like news and social media. Prior work mostly treats stock movement prediction as a regression or classification task and is not directly optimized towards profit-making. Further, they do not model the fine-grain temporal irregularities in the release of vast volumes of text that the market responds to quickly. Building on these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical, learning to rank approach that uses textual data to make time-aware predictions for ranking stocks based on expected profit. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 8\% in terms of cumulative profit and risk-adjusted returns in trading simulations on two benchmarks: English tweets and Chinese financial news spanning two major stock indexes and four global markets. Through ablative and qualitative analyses, we build the case for our method as a tool for daily stock trading.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new text-mining methodology that extracts information from news articles to predict asset returns. Unlike more common sentiment scores used for stock return prediction (e.g., those sold by commercial vendors or built with dictionary-based methods), our supervised learning framework constructs a score that is specifically adapted to the problem of return prediction. Our method proceeds in three steps: 1) isolating a list of terms via predictive screening, 2) assigning prediction weights to these words via topic modeling, and 3) aggregating terms into an article-level predictive score via penalized likelihood. We derive theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of estimates from our model with minimal assumptions. In our empirical analysis, we study one of the most actively monitored streams of news articles in the financial system--the Dow Jones Newswires--and show that our supervised text model excels at extracting return-predictive signals in this context. Information in newswires is assimilated into prices with an ineffcient delay that is broadly consistent with limits-to-arbitrage (i.e., more severe for smaller and more volatile firms) yet can be exploited in a real-time trading strategy with reasonable turnover and net of transaction costs.},

Text mining study is believed to prevent the world from entering that era. One of the text mining studies that may prevent the explosion era is text classification. It is a way to classify articles into several predefined categories. In this research, the classifier implements TF-IDF algorithm. TF-IDF is an algorithm that counts the word weight by considering frequency of the word (TF) and in how many files the word can be found (IDF). Since the IDF could see the in how many files a term can be found, it can control the weight of each word. When a word can be found in so many files, it will be considered as an unimportant word. TF-IDF has been proven to create a classifier that could classify news articles in Bahasa Indonesia in a high accuracy; 98.3\%.},

Natural language processing methods can be used to extract market sentiment information from texts such as news articles. The objective of this paper is to extract financial market sentiment information from news articles and use the estimated sentiment scores to predict the price direction of the stock market index Standard \& Poor’s 500. To achieve the best possible performance in sentiment classification, state-of-the-art bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models are used. The pretrained transformer networks are fine-tuned on a labeled financial text dataset and applied to news articles from known providers of financial news content to predict their sentiment scores. The generated sentiment scores for the titles of the given news articles, for the (text) content of said news articles, and for the combined title-content consideration are posited against past time series information of the stock market index. To forecast the price direction of the stock market index, the predicted sentiment scores are used in a simple strategy and as features for a random forest classifier. The results show that sentiment scores based on news content are particularly useful for stock price direction prediction.},

For this purpose, different deep learning methodologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and a new generation natural language processing model, namely Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are employed for classification task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for analyzing the direction of stocks by using both CNN, RNN, LSTM, BERT and texts from social media platforms. Experimental results represent that the utilization of deep learning models and a new generation word embedding model which is called BERT boosts the classification performance.

This is the task to predict the movement of stock prices in the future based on historical trends. The approach to predicting the movement based solely on the pattern of the historical movement of it on charts, not on fundamental values, is called the Technical Analysis, which can be divided into univariate and multivariate methods in the regression task. According to the latter approach, it is important to select different factors well as inputs to enhance the performance of the model. Moreover, its performance can depend on which loss is used to train the model. However, most studies tend to focus on building the structures of models, not on how to select informative factors as inputs to train them. In this paper, we propose a method that can get better performance in terms of returns when selecting informative factors using the cointegration test and learning the model using quantile loss. We compare the two RNN variants with quantile loss with only five factors obtained through the cointegration test among the entire 15 stock index factors collected in the experiment. The Cumulative return and Sharpe ratio were used to evaluate the performance of trained models. Our experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the other conventional approaches.},

The ANN forecasts the lowest and highest stock prices of the current trading day. The system was tested with the two main stocks of the BM\&FBOVESPA, an important and understudied market. A series of experiments were performed using different data input configurations, and compared with four benchmarks. The results were evaluated using both classical evaluation metrics, such as the ANN generalization error, and more general metrics, such as the annualized return. The ANN showed to be more accurate and give more return to the investor than the four benchmarks. The best results obtained by the ANN had an mean absolute percentage error around 50\% smaller than the best benchmark, and doubled the capital of the investor.},

The growth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and commodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of Deep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been proven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of technical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and investors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the investors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have been used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced neural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to predict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and headlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an ensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly sentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc, listed on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a pre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Afterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for Apple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries, some commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores. Comparison is done with baseline models like - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), vanilla GAN, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.},

	abstract = {Recent scientific studies on natural language processing (NLP) report the outstanding effectiveness observed in the use of context-dependent and task-free language understanding models such as ELMo, GPT, and BERT. Specifically, they have proved to achieve state of the art performance in numerous complex NLP tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis in the English language. Following the great popularity and effectiveness that these models are gaining in the scientific community, we trained a BERT language understanding model for the Italian language (AlBERTo). In particular , AlBERTo is focused on the language used in social networks, specifically on Twitter. To demonstrate its ro-bustness, we evaluated AlBERTo on the EVALITA 2016 task SENTIPOLC (SEN-TIment POLarity Classification) obtaining state of the art results in subjectiv-ity, polarity and irony detection on Ital-ian tweets. The pre-trained AlBERTo model will be publicly distributed through the GitHub platform at the following web address: https://github.com/ marcopoli/AlBERTo-it in order to facilitate future research.},

	abstract = {We develop FinBERT, a state-of-the-art large language model that adapts to the finance domain. We show that FinBERT incorporates finance knowledge and can better summarize contextual information in financial texts. Using a sample of researcher-labeled sentences from analyst reports, we document that FinBERT substantially outperforms the Loughran and McDonald dictionary and other machine learning algorithms, including naïve Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory, in sentiment classification. Our results show that FinBERT excels in identifying the positive or negative sentiment of sentences that other algorithms mislabel as neutral, likely because it uses contextual information in financial text. We find that FinBERT's advantage over other algorithms, and Google's original bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model, is especially salient when the training sample size is small and in texts containing financial words not frequently used in general texts. FinBERT also outperforms other models in identifying discussions related to environment, social, and governance issues. Last, we show that other approaches underestimate the textual informativeness of earnings conference calls by at least 18\% compared to FinBERT. Our results have implications for academic researchers, investment professionals, and financial market regulators.},

	abstract = {Financial market predictions utilize historical data to anticipate future stock prices and market trends. Traditionally, these predictions have focused on the statistical analysis of quantitative factors, such as stock prices, trading volumes, inflation rates, and changes in industrial production. Recent advancements in large language models motivate the integrated financial analysis of both sentiment data, particularly market news, and numerical factors. Nonetheless, this methodology frequently encounters constraints due to the paucity of extensive datasets that amalgamate both quantitative and qualitative sentiment analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a large-scale financial dataset, namely, Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID). It comprises 29.7 million stock prices and 15.7 million time-aligned financial news records for 4,775 S\&P500 companies, covering the period from 1999 to 2023, sourced from 4 stock market news websites. We demonstrate that FNSPID excels existing stock market datasets in scale and diversity while uniquely incorporating sentiment information. Through financial analysis experiments on FNSPID, we propose: (1) the dataset's size and quality significantly boost market prediction accuracy; (2) adding sentiment scores modestly enhances performance on the transformer-based model; (3) a reproducible procedure that can update the dataset. Completed work, code, documentation, and examples are available at github.com/Zdong104/FNSPID. FNSPID offers unprecedented opportunities for the financial research community to advance predictive modeling and analysis.},

We use ChatGPT to assess whether each headline is good, bad, or neutral for firms' stock prices. We document a significantly positive correlation between ChatGPT scores and subsequent daily stock returns. We find that ChatGPT outperforms traditional sentiment analysis methods. More basic models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, and BERT cannot accurately forecast returns, indicating return predictability is an emerging capacity of complex language models. Long-short strategies based on ChatGPT-4 deliver the highest Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, we find predictability in both small and large stocks, suggesting market underreaction to company news. Predictability is stronger among smaller stocks and stocks with bad news, consistent with limits-to-arbitrage also playing an important role. Finally, we propose a new method to evaluate and understand the models' reasoning capabilities. Overall, our results suggest that incorporating advanced language models into the investment decision-making process can yield more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of quantitative trading strategies.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that stock price movements are influenced by news. To predict stock movements with news, many existing works rely only on the news title since the news content may contain irrelevancies which seriously degrade the prediction accuracy. However, we observe that there is still useful information in the content which is not reflected in the title, and simply ignoring the content will result in poor performance. In this paper, taking advantage of neural representation learning, we propose a hierarchical complementary attention network (HCAN) to capture valuable complementary information in news title and content for stock movement prediction. In HCAN, we adopt a two-level attention mechanism to quantify the importances of the words and sentences in a given news. Moreover, we design a novel measurement for calculating the attention weights to avoid capturing redundant information in the news title and content. Experimental results on news datasets show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {Stock trend prediction plays a critical role in seeking maximized profit from stock investment. However, precise trend prediction is very difficult since the highly volatile and non-stationary nature of stock market. Exploding information on Internet together with advancing development of natural language processing and text mining techniques have enable investors to unveil market trends and volatility from online content. Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market varies drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we designed a Hybrid Attention Networks to predict the stock trend based on the sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},
