	abstract = {With approximately 900 million observations we conduct, to our knowledge, the largest study ever of intraday stock return predictability using machine learning techniques finding consistent out-of-sample predictability across market, sector, and individual stock returns at various time horizons. While linear models have the strongest statistical predictive power, nonlinear models economically dominate them and machine learning intraday long-short portfolios based on their forecasts attain Sharpe ratios of 4 after transaction costs. Predictability is short-lived, highest in the middle of the day, and more pronounced for less liquid firms, which indicates that slow-moving capital is an economic source of mispricing.},

In particular, we find that large daytime returns followed by overnight news with strong sentiment lead to a predictable return reversal during the subsequent trading day. This predictable reversal is present independent of the polarity of the news sentiment. Without overnight news, large previous-day returns only have marginal predictive power.},

However, complex language can also reflect the provision of complex information, e.g., informative technical disclosure. As a consequence, linguistic complexity commingles two latent components — obfuscation and information — that are related to information asymmetry in opposite directions. We develop a novel empirical approach to estimate these two latent components within the context of quarterly earnings conference calls. We validate our estimates of these two latent components by examining their relation to information asymmetry. Consistent with our predictions, we find that our estimate of the information component is negatively associated with information asymmetry while our estimate of the obfuscation component is positively associated with information asymmetry. Our findings suggest that future research on linguistic complexity can construct more powerful tests by separately examining these two latent components of linguistic complexity.},

Prior work mostly treats stock movement prediction as a regression or classification task and is not directly optimized towards profit-making. Further, they do not model the fine-grain temporal irregularities in the release of vast volumes of text that the market responds to quickly. Building on these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical, learning to rank approach that uses textual data to make time-aware predictions for ranking stocks based on expected profit. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 8\% in terms of cumulative profit and risk-adjusted returns in trading simulations on two benchmarks: English tweets and Chinese financial news spanning two major stock indexes and four global markets. Through ablative and qualitative analyses, we build the case for our method as a tool for daily stock trading.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new text-mining methodology that extracts information from news articles to predict asset returns. Unlike more common sentiment scores used for stock return prediction (e.g., those sold by commercial vendors or built with dictionary-based methods), our supervised learning framework constructs a score that is specifically adapted to the problem of return prediction. Our method proceeds in three steps: 1) isolating a list of terms via predictive screening, 2) assigning prediction weights to these words via topic modeling, and 3) aggregating terms into an article-level predictive score via penalized likelihood. We derive theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of estimates from our model with minimal assumptions. In our empirical analysis, we study one of the most actively monitored streams of news articles in the financial system--the Dow Jones Newswires--and show that our supervised text model excels at extracting return-predictive signals in this context. Information in newswires is assimilated into prices with an ineffcient delay that is broadly consistent with limits-to-arbitrage (i.e., more severe for smaller and more volatile firms) yet can be exploited in a real-time trading strategy with reasonable turnover and net of transaction costs.},

TF-IDF is an algorithm that counts the word weight by considering frequency of the word (TF) and in how many files the word can be found (IDF). Since the IDF could see the in how many files a term can be found, it can control the weight of each word. When a word can be found in so many files, it will be considered as an unimportant word. TF-IDF has been proven to create a classifier that could classify news articles in Bahasa Indonesia in a high accuracy; 98.3\%.},

Natural language processing methods can be used to extract market sentiment information from texts such as news articles. The objective of this paper is to extract financial market sentiment information from news articles and use the estimated sentiment scores to predict the price direction of the stock market index Standard \& Poor’s 500. To achieve the best possible performance in sentiment classification, state-of-the-art bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models are used. The pretrained transformer networks are fine-tuned on a labeled financial text dataset and applied to news articles from known providers of financial news content to predict their sentiment scores. The generated sentiment scores for the titles of the given news articles, for the (text) content of said news articles, and for the combined title-content consideration are posited against past time series information of the stock market index. To forecast the price direction of the stock market index, the predicted sentiment scores are used in a simple strategy and as features for a random forest classifier. The results show that sentiment scores based on news content are particularly useful for stock price direction prediction.},
