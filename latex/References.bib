	abstract = {With approximately 900 million observations we conduct, to our knowledge, the largest study ever of intraday stock return predictability using machine learning techniques finding consistent out-of-sample predictability across market, sector, and individual stock returns at various time horizons. While linear models have the strongest statistical predictive power, nonlinear models economically dominate them and machine learning intraday long-short portfolios based on their forecasts attain Sharpe ratios of 4 after transaction costs. Predictability is short-lived, highest in the middle of the day, and more pronounced for less liquid firms, which indicates that slow-moving capital is an economic source of mispricing.},

	abstract = {I investigate the impact of financial news on equity returns and introduce a non-parametric model to generate a sentiment signal, which is then used as a predictor for short-term, single-stock equity return forecasts. I build on Googleâ€™s BERT model and sequentially pre-train and fine-tune it using Thomson Reuters financial news data covering the period from 1996 to 2020. With daily returndata of S\&P 500 constituents, the analysis shows that financial news carry information that is not immediately reflected in equity prices. News is largely priced-in within one day, with diffusion varying across industries. A trading strategy that leverages the sentiment signal generates an average return per trade of 24.06 bps over an 18 year out-of-sample period.},

In this paper we apply the popular word embedding methods and deep neural networks to leverage financial news to predict stock price movements in the market. Experimental results have shown that our proposed methods are simple but very effective, which can significantly improve the stock prediction accuracy on a standard financial database over the baseline system using only the historical price information.},
